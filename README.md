> An R interface to [deweypy](https://github.com/dewey-data/deweypy) for downloading files from the Dewey file management system.





## Overview

`deweyr` provides a simple way to download files from Dewey folders directly from R, without requiring manual Python environment setup. The package offers two download methods:

- **`dewey_download()`** - Recommended method using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (automatic Python environment management)
- **`dewey_download_py()`** - Traditional method using an existing Python installation

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Coxabc/deweyr")
```

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Using UV (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started - no Python installation required:
```r
library(deweyr)

download_dewey(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "your-folder-id"
)
```

> **First-time setup:** If UV isn't installed, `deweyr` will install it automatically. You may see a message recommending you restart your terminal for optimal performance in future runs.



### Method 2: Using Existing Python

If you already have Python and deweypy installed:
```r
library(deweyr)

download_dewey_py(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "your-folder-id"
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Download
```r
# Download to default location (./dewey-downloads)
download_dewey(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "abc123"
)
```

### Custom Download Location
```r
# Specify where to save files
download_dewey(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "abc123",
  download_path = "C:/Users/YourName/Documents/data"
)
```

### Download from URL

You can use either a folder ID or the full Dewey URL:
```r
download_dewey(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "https://api.deweydata.io/api/v1/external/data/abc123"
)
```
## Advanced Options

### Multi-threaded Downloads

Adjust the number of workers for faster downloads (default is 8):
```r
download_dewey(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "abc123",
  num_workers = 16  # Use 16 parallel workers
)
```

### Date-Partitioned Datasets

For datasets partitioned by date, you can filter which partitions to download:
```r
# Download only data from 2024 onwards
download_dewey(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "abc123",
  partition_key_after = "2024-01-01"
)

# Download only data up to a certain date
download_dewey(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "abc123",
  partition_key_before = "2023-12-31"
)

# Download a specific date range
download_dewey(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "abc123",
  partition_key_after = "2024-01-01",
  partition_key_before = "2024-03-31"
)
```

## Duck DB Options

### Download from Duck DB

```r
download_dewey_duck(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  data_id = "dataset-from-deweydata",
  partition = "column-name-to-partition-by",
  where = NULL,
  select = NULL,
  overwrite=FALSE
)
```

### Read Using Duck DB

```r
read_dewey_duck(
  path = "path-to-read-in-already-downloaded-data",
  where = NULL
)
```

### Get Dewey URL 

```r
get_dewey_urls_duck(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  data_id = "dataset-from-deweydata",
  preview = FALSE
)
```

### Preview with Duck DB

```r
preview_dewey_duck(
  api_key = "your-api-key",
  data_id = "dataset-from-deweydata",
  limit = 10,
  where = NULL
)
```
